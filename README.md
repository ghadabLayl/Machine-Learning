# Machine-Learning

In this repository, I will display my walkthrough in ML concepts, by following [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course), and adding additional small projects.


## Roadmap

- [Linear Regression](#linear-regression)
    - Notes
    - Linear Regression Project

- [Logistic Regression](#logistic-regression)


## Linear Regression
Linear Regression consists of finding relationship between features and labels, using the best-fit linear equation.
### Notes
The notes are provided in the [Linear Regression notes file](https://github.com/ghadabLayl/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/LinearRegressionNotes.txt). They summarize the course in a brief way to help to understand more the concept of Linear Regression.
### Linear Regression Project
The project follows a basic Youtube tutorial from [Python ML Daily](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCVIwUQJ_a6x5M9mdhEpO_IdtFrRtAyaY&si=48p44cjWjoC7-Fc0). In this project, we visualized and applied Linear Regression concepts, from splitting the data into training and testing, reading csv files, and creating the model, using the correct Python libraries.
